Bedroom
I woke up in a smelling little bedroom, without windows. 
By the bed I was laying in was a small table and to the north a glass door. 
On the floor was a sports magazine.  
There's a small table here. The small table contains:
A reading lamp
A wallet

>look at lamp
There's nothing special about it.

>look at wallet
It's made of cheap imitation leather.

>take wallet
Taken.

>inventory
I'm carrying:
A wallet

>look inside wallet
I don't have a dime.
```
